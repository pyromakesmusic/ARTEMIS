        <p class="card-text">ARTEMIS stands for the Agency for Rescue Technology, Emergency Management and International Security. Broadly speaking, it is an open source project to save the world. That puts it in the same boat as countless other businesses, foundations, non-profits and initiatives. ARTEMIS's unique contribution to this humanitarian and environmental movement will be driven by its approach to structure. Agile development methodologies, worker ownership, peer-to-peer training, a flexible and iterative approach to command and control, and core prioritization of community empowerment and development will allow ARTEMIS to have maximum impact, starting with the East Austin communities that catalyzed its inception. </p>

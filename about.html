        <p class="card-text">ARTEMIS stands for the Agency for Rescue Technology, Emergency Management and International Security. Broadly speaking, it is an open source project to save the world. That puts it in the same boat as countless other businesses, foundations, non-profits and initiatives. ARTEMIS's unique contribution to this humanitarian and environmental movement will be driven by its approach to structure. Agile development methodologies, worker ownership, peer-to-peer training, a flexible and iterative approach to command and control, and core prioritization of community empowerment and development will allow ARTEMIS to have maximum impact, starting with the East Austin community that has catalyzed its inception. </p>
		<h2 class="card-title">The Work</h2>
		  <h3 class="card-title">Rescue Technology</h3>
		  <p class="card-text">Rescue is experiencing a shift in importance for security at all levels of scale. Natural and biological disasters and civil unrest are only a few of the dangers that can change our world. This has an operational impact on rescue organizations, both in terms of creating new hazards which agencies may be called to respond to, and new risks rescue operators must weigh when deciding what action to take, or if it's safe to act at all.</p> 
	    <p class="card-text">
		  ARTEMIS seeks to contribute to this space through the development of open-source tools and hardware designs for the construction, analysis, optimization and security of powered and passive exoskeleton technology. Existing development in this space has used a mix of approaches, from simple reinforcement for load-bearing activities to powered hydraulic frames that multiply the input force by many orders of magnitude. In order to best serve the rescue community, ARTEMIS exoskeleton development will focus on safety, mobility, comfort, and ease of use while operating with a variety of PPE necessary for all types of rescue missions.
	    </p>
	    <p class="card-text">It is important to recognize the possible implications in the development of any kind of technology, regardless of what it does, and exoskeletons are no exception. </p>
